 Obey, Supreme, Diamond Clothing, Undefeated. Ever since intermediate school, I've always been interested on art and how these clothing companies create these shirts and stickers. How to they come up with ideas and make it cool. How do they get to inspire to generate something from nothing and become something you proudly wear? Being able to create something out of nothing and make it cool is a very appealing aspect that applies to being software engineer.

  Graphic Design and Software Engineer represent two different names yet they share the similar idea. From brainstorming to design, from endless revisions to sigh of relief after the end product is finished. These two subjects are the same thing. The satisfaction of displaying your sticker in someones laptop is the same aspect as someone who's using that laptop is using your app! Being able to affect peoples lives in terms of fashion or a convenient way of living, that's what make want to learn about.

  Right now, I'm attending a college class about being a software engineer. I hope I can apply my experience of being a Graphic Designer and impact as many people through coding. I want to create something out of nothing, from a blank text file, I will develop an application that will change the world. If not, inspire the younger generation to surpass my designs and create their own art.
