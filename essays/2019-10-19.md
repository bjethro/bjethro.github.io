 If you wanna learn about coding, I'd best suggest to start with javascript. Comparing to other language that I have learned in college, Javascript is a language that doesn't require many rules to be remembered and is prevelant language in the real world being used by many companies and applications.  Javascript lets you create things with less constrictions which would be less work and debugging in the end compared to other programming language I have learned.
  
  Tips on becoming good with javascript: Take a class if you can. Being in a class setting with students that are learning the same concept and being able to ask for help can increase your skills on writing javascript. I am currently taking a class called ICS 314. This class accelerated my learnng through "WODS". These are exercises that are given to us by our professors that has to be done in a certain amount time. This gives enables us to dig deep in our brain to figure out the code and practice javascript problem solving. The timer really urges us to think and really apply our tutorials in to the test. Having these type of exercise accelerate your learning.
